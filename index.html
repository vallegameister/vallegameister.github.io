            <h2> Dogs Have an Incredible Sense of Smell</h2>
            <p> Dogs have around 300 million smell receptors, compared to just 5 million in humans. They can detect scents up to 100,000 times better than we can!</p>

            <h2> Each Dog's Nose Print is Unique</h2>
            <p> Just like human fingerprints, each dog's nose print has a unique pattern, making it possible to identify them through their nose alone.</p>
